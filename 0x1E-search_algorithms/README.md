<center>Sorting Algorithms</center>
In  this project well be dealing with sorting algorithms. lemme ask youz how do you determine thr best algoeithm to use ?


Using big O notation we can determine the best algorithm to use by checking the worst case scenario..

A tip// always remember, the constant do matter, so dont be adding it as as the data keeps on being added, or increased, it looses its value, but in small datasets it makes a diffrence.

better ====> O(n)
